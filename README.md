If you want to only download the ISOs, without reading why I do this, go to my [Internet Archive profile](https://archive.org/details/@deboniet).

# What is Android-x86?

It's an open source project that ports Android to the x86 arquitecture so it can be executed on the computers that have that CPU arquitecure. The project is not mine. This repository it's just a link for the ISOs I built, and a memo of the the things I'm doing to archive the versions that are not in a ISO format.

# Why did you create this repository?

First, there are no official Android 10 and Android 11 ISOs from the developers of the project. Secondly, in the summer of 2024, OSDN servers went down for long periods of time. Right now, it's not possible to even connect to their servers. I thought that archiving those versions it's a good way of preserving that part of the Android x86 project.

Anyways, if you want to compile it by yourself you can use [my script](https://github.com/deboniet/scripts-bash/blob/main/androidx86build.sh) or you can follow [the outdated and not working official instructions](https://www.android-x86.org/source.html).

# How was the ISOs done?
Based on the official instructions. The compilation options and other information are the default ones, and can be viewed on **system/build.prop** inside the ISOs.

# How do I get the ISOs?

The ISOs are on Internet Archive, an organization that preserve the Internet. I think it's the best place to put this.

# There will be more versions?

Yes, it's the plan. I would like to upload all posible versions of Android 10 and 11.
